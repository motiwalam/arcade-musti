# Arcade Musti

A collection of popular games I recreated. The list of implemented games includes

* 2048
* Wordle
* Fifteen
* 24
* Sudoku
* Flow
* Minesweeper
* Anagrams
* Crosslogic

Where I could, I made the game general in its parameters (so Wordle can change the number of guesses and letters in the word, Sudoku can be 9x9, 16x16, etc.).

## Building and developing
Run `npm run build` to create a deployment build. The resultant `build` folder should be deployed at `/arcade/` on a server.

Run `npm run start` to start a development server. By default, the app will be available at `localhost:3000`.

## Code structure
This arcade was previously a part of a private project made as a present for a loved one and was recently isolated into its own application. If there are large sections of unused code, this is likely why.

TODO: include description of code structure.
